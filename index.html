        <ul>
            <li><b>1994</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>

            to school study under Stakamn, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
            <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack. but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work 
            on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, desinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
            <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plants Pathology</li>
            <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to a head a new plant 
            pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties of
             each major climate on Earth</li>
            <li><b>1945</b> - Discorvers a way to grown wheat twice each season doubling wheat yields</li>
            <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeildling America breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. 
            It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <li><b>1962</b> - Visit Delhi and brings his high-yieldling strains of wheat to hte Indian subcontinent in tile to help mitigate mass starvation 
            due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
            <li><b>1970</b> - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize.</li>

            <li><b>2005</b> - States "we will have to double hte world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only we can meet
            the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and 
            animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the bestbreeds."</li>
            <li><b>2009</b> - Dies at the age of 95. <br>
                <p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect persistence and scientific vision
                can make to human peace and progress."</p>
